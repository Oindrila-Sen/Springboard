Then we could run a two-tailed z-test comparing sample proportions (since that is what the ratio is). This would give us a z-score and associated p-value. A low p-value (say at α=0.01) would potentially indicate a significant change in our KPI (good or bad). We could further calculate the confidence intervals for this to be able to strongly claim a statistical change in the KPI, if it exists."
